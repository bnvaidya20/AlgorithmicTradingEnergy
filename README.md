# Algorithmic Trading in the Energy Sector

This repository is dedicated to exploring algorithmic trading strategies within the energy sector. 

Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or algo-trading, involves using computer programs that execute trades based on predefined algorithms. These algorithms dictate when to buy or sell assets, aiming to generate profits at speeds and volumes unattainable by human traders.

Utilizing historical stock data, the project applies Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategies to analyze and predict stock performances of major energy companies.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source**: Leverages the Alpha Vantage API for fetching real-time and historical stock data.
- **Stock Analysis**: Analyzes stock data focusing on the energy sector, including major companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and more.
- **Trading Strategy**: Implements and evaluates Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategies.
- **Backtesting**: Employs backtesting to assess the efficacy of trading strategies over time.
- **Visualization**: Offers comprehensive visualization tools to plot stock performances, SMAs, and trading signals.
